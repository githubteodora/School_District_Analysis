# School District Analysis

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the perfomance of all schools in an examnple School District. Funding, student grades and average math and reading scores were taken into consideration in order to get to a full view of a school's performance. The analysis was carried out twice, because potential academic dishonesty was spotted in grade 9 of one of the schools. 

## System Settings:
Pandas, Jupyter, Anaconda

## Code:

## Project Iterations:
1.  First Iteration: all data, all schools and pupils;
2.  Second Iteration: math and reading scores belonging to children in 9th grade of Thomas High School got zeroed out and excluded from the calculations;

### First Iteration - Discoveries:
 - School Performance Overview:

 - Per School Size Overview

  - Per Student Spending, Grouping & Performance

#### Conclusions:
1. Charter schools perform better as compared with district schools.
2. Pupils in small and medium sized schools tend to outperform their peers in Large schools (on average).
3. Top 5 schools: Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School	, Pena High School

### Second Iteration:
 - Changes: zeroed out the scores for 9th graders in Thomas Hight School - see the "nan" values below:

#### Colclusions:
1. No material changes can be observed, so the change did not lead to any substantial differences overall;
2. Top 5 schools: unchanged; 
3. The overall schore for THS fell slightly from 90.94% to 90.63%;
